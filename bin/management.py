This file provides various utilities for mamnaging the module planner.
Current features include:

    => Data Management

        - Verification: Given a specification of what should define
        a module, course etc. This will check whether or not any
        records are not compliant with this specification

        - Conversion: While Jeckyll uses YAML to store its data for the
        module info pages, the module planner will work best with
        JSON so this provides tools for converting it

        - Compilation: The data is spread out accross all the pages of the
        site however ideally we want to be downloading as few files as
        possible over the web so this compiles all the data into a single
        JSON file
