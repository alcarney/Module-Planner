# Module Planner

The module planner is a jekyll website combined with some python
and javascript magic which will present the user with an interactive
graph of modules for their selected degree course.

Users will also be able to select certain modules and then see how these
choices will affect their possible future courses. This will allow them to
help decide which modules makes the most sense for their degree program

This site contains the documentation for the how this site is implemented
