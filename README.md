Contributing
============

There are many tasks that need completing before this can even be considered useful:

  - Students should be able to select the modules they wish to take
  - Students should be able to select their degree scheme as this alters which
    modules are core and what optional modules are available
  - Modules should disappear/be grayed as they become unavailable
  - We need a good way of handling the placement of modules on screen 
    so that related modules are placed near each other so that we dont have a mess.
  - Of course it must look pretty!
  - And much more in the future
